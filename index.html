<h1>Learn LOCK</h1>
<p>This website is surposed to tell you how to program in my programming language, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/524126957/">LOCK</a>
. It is a very simple language and was made to help people move from scratch, to text based languages, in a slightly easier way.
You satart out with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/524126957/">NUMBERS</a>, and then move on to LOCK. sadly, LOCK is still in development.</p>
<h1>Chapter one: Basics of NUMBERS</h1>
<p>The console is something you need to get familiar with as it is a big part to NUMBERS. When running your code it does do some 14 second operations.
    This is checking if it is stable or not, and several others. When you start it will say "console has been booted correctly
    Code service has been booted correctly
    code (numbers)" then, it will tell you to write a code. Here are the codes (as of right now.)
        1 = move Y
        2 = move X
        3 = go to a position
        4 = set colour
        5= set brightness
        6= wait seconds.
         you can do these in the list order and click run!

<h1>Chapter two: requirements</h1>
<p>You need a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">scratch</a> account (preferably a scratcher) and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/524126957/">NUMBERS</a>
open. You will also need a computer that is at least 5 or 6 years old. But before starting, read the "Basics of NUMBERS section"</p>
